### REACT REDUX AUTH TEMPLATE
This is the code from an amazing tutorial by Stephen Grider on Udemy involving Advanced React and Redux. This particular repo covers authentication, login, signup, signout, tokens, authentication and more. Bare bones but very useful.

If using this as a clone, will also need a config.js file in the root server directory like so:

module.exports = {
	secret: 'enteryoursecretvaluehere'
}
